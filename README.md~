# Stopwatch
A very simple stopwatch made for personal use using Python. 

The idea of the script is to track the time spent working or studying Software Engineering stuffs daily. 

This script could be used by anyone who tries to spend more time studying or focusing on a determined tag. Just start the script when you start and you're ready to track your time in a really simple and lightweight way.

# How to use

## For Windows:

* Make sure that you have Python 3 installed. If not, you can download it from this link: 
```
https://www.python.org/download/releases/3.0/
```

* Open Windows PowerShell and navigate to the folder named stopwatch using cd, for example:
```
cd .\NameOfFolder\stopwatch\
```


* Inside the Windows PowerShell run:

```
py.exe .\stopwatch.py

```

Work in progress. Made with Windows in mind(for now).
